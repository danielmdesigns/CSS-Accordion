You can browse through eCommission's Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. However, if you want to use our Web site's services, you must register with us by providing personal information.

We only use your personal information to help us service your account, to improve our services to you, to provide you with payment of your real estate commissions on a factored basis, and to inform you about any promotions that may be of interest to you. We will not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. In the event that court orders or laws mandate eCommission to disclose personal information, we will do so only to the extent required by law.

In order to use our Web site's services, you must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to give two kinds of information: personal and sales transaction information. Personal information collected includes: customer name, home/business address, home/business phone and fax numbers, email address(es), birth date, site password, password reminder (mother's maiden name, birth city, pet's name) and Social Security number. Transaction information collected includes: buyer/seller names, property address, deposit amount, sale type (condo, new home construction, town home, etc.), purchase price, closing entity (attorney, title company), closing date, and commission earned.

This information is collected for several reasons. Social Security numbers are used for customer identification purposes as well as to provide them with tax related information. The remaining personal information is collected to create a database of customer information that avoids re-entering the same information every time our services are used. We also use this information to contact you about the services on our site for which you have expressed interest. Transaction information is collected so we can verify that a sale occurred and it was valid.
